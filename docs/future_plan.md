# Wikidata Tool: Future Development Plan

This document outlines the ambitious future development plan for the `wikidata-tool`, aiming to establish a comprehensive semantic analysis pipeline for our codebase.

## Core Functionality Expansion

### 1. Comprehensive Repository Scanning

*   **Objective:** The tool will leverage our existing submodule functions to perform a deep scan across all submodules and repositories within the project.
*   **Data Extraction:** During this scan, it will identify and extract:
    *   **URLs:** Any web links found within code comments, documentation, configuration files, etc.
    *   **Terms:** Key terms, phrases, and entities relevant to the project's domain, potentially identified through natural language processing or predefined lexicons.

### 2. Wikipedia and Wikidata Integration

*   **Objective:** For each extracted URL and term, the tool will intelligently query Wikipedia and Wikidata to gather relevant semantic information.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Wikipedia Link Lookup:** Attempt to find corresponding Wikipedia articles for identified terms and URLs.
    *   **Page Retrieval:** Fetch the content of these Wikipedia pages.
    *   **Wikidata Extraction:** From the Wikipedia pages (or directly from terms/URLs), extract associated Wikidata entity links (Q-IDs).
    *   **Wikidata Fetching:** Retrieve detailed data for these Wikidata entities.

### 3. Robust Caching Mechanism

*   **Objective:** Implement a persistent and efficient caching system to store fetched Wikipedia pages and Wikidata entities.
*   **Benefit:** This will prevent redundant API calls, speed up subsequent analyses, and allow for offline processing.

### 4. Intelligent Wikidata Node Expansion (Depth N)

*   **Objective:** Beyond initial lookups, the tool will intelligently expand its knowledge graph by traversing Wikidata relationships up to a configurable depth (N).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each initially identified Wikidata node, explore its properties and related entities.
    *   Prioritize expansion based on relevance, predefined property types, or other intelligent heuristics to avoid unbounded growth.
    *   For newly discovered Wikidata nodes, pull in their corresponding Wikipedia pages.
*   **Benefit:** This creates a richer, more interconnected semantic context around the codebase's entities.

### 5. Semantic Code Chunk Analysis

*   **Objective:** Utilize the gathered Wikipedia and expanded Wikidata information to semantically analyze chunks of our codebase.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Word List Comparison:** Compare extracted terms and entities from code chunks against the comprehensive word lists derived from Wikipedia and Wikidata.
    *   **Similarity Matching:** Employ algorithms to find the most semantically similar Wikidata page (or a set of pages) for each identified chunk of code.
*   **Ultimate Goal:** To provide a deep understanding of what each part of the code *means* in a broader knowledge context, facilitating documentation, refactoring, and knowledge discovery.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the repository scanning functionality.
*   Develop the Wikipedia lookup and Wikidata extraction/fetching modules.
*   Design and implement the caching layer.
*   Begin work on the intelligent Wikidata expansion strategy.
*   Integrate word list analysis and similarity matching algorithms.
